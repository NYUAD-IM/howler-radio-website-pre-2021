  "description": "Research Paper Radio contains multitudes: from 1920s showtunes and Dada sound collage to 1980s synthpop and international new wave to this year's new indie releases, sometimes in a single set. Tracks occasionally played in alphabetical order. Never the same show twice.<br><br><u>Disclaimer:</u> No actual research papers have been harmed or even discussed in the making of this show, but the music's so good you might find yourself itching to write about it.",
